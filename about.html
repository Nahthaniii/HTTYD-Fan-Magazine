      <h2>From Berk to the Hidden World: A Fan's Story</h2>
      <p><b>By Nathan Laurence Aguas</b></p>
      <div class="author-item"><img src="images/nathan.jpg" alt="Nathan Aguas"> 
      <p style="color: white;"><b>I still remember the very first time I discovered How to Train Your Dragon. I was curious about the movie when it came out, but I didn't expect it to leave such a big impact on me. From the moment Hiccup and Toothless looked at each other for the first time, I knew this story was different. It wasn't just about dragons, it was about trust, friendship, and finding your place in the world.
	      <br><br>My first impression was pure wonder. The flying scenes especially took my breath away. It felt like freedom, like being lifted out of reality into a place where anything was possible. The animation, the music, and the emotions. It all blended into something unforgettable.
	      <br><br>The character I connect with the most is Hiccup. Like him, I've often felt a little out of place, trying to prove myself while staying true to who I am. His journey of embracing his uniqueness instead of hiding it really resonates with me.
	      <br><br>If I had the chance to own a dragon I would pick a Razorwhip because that dragon will never abandon you once you gain its trust and it's a stealthy also pretty fast dragon.
	      <br><br>The franchise has taught me so much about courage, leadership, and empathy. It showed me that strength doesn't always mean fighting. It can also mean understanding and compassion. It even inspired my creativity, whether through drawing, writing, or just daydreaming about what life would be like in Berk.
	      <br><br>My favorite memory of watching it in cinema was when Hiccup, Astrid, Fishlegs, Snotlout, Tuffnut and Ruffnut built the dragons edge. I really liked their base because it looked so amazing, and they had their own spot to put their favorites stuffs like the boar pit of Ruffnut and Ruffnut, the hanger where they put their dragons , and when the night terrors helped them by acting like guards to protect the dragons edge from enemies.
	      <br><br>A scene in HTTYD 2 where it made me really sad was when Toothless being controlled was gonna blast Hiccup but then Stoick saved Hiccup by pushing Hiccup away from the blast while Stoick dying in the process. I got really sad because Hiccup could've just dogged it but I feel like Stoick didn't think Hiccup could've so dogged it.
	      <br><br>When I watch Race to the Dragons Edge, a series of HTTYD, I could never stop watching it because it's so captivating. I don't get bored while watching it or any other movies/short films of HTTYD franchise.
	      <br><br>I've expressed my fandom in little ways. When I was in Grade 3, my primary grade school had a costume day where we could wear anything we wanted, so I decided to dress up as Toothless. My uncle made it for me and when he finished doing it, I was shocked because it was so tall and when I wore it, I almost fell down. It was very heavy, but I was so happy because it felt like I was Toothless that day.
	      <br><br>Being a How to Train Your Dragon fan means carrying with me a sense of wonder, bravery, and hope. It's more than just a movie franchise. It's a reminder that even if you feel different, you can still change the world in your own way.</b></p>
