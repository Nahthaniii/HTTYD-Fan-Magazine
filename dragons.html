    <h2>Classes of Dragons</h2>
    <p><b>The dragons known to the Hairy Hooligan Tribe are grouped into seven "classes" based on their similar abilities or features (unlike modern taxonomy that is based on shared physical characteristics). Dragons can also be moved between classes if new discoveries about a species make it necessary. The seven classes are Boulder, Mystery, Sharp, Stoker, Strike, Tidal and Tracker. </b> </p>

Confined to land, they rely on ice bridges and glaciers to move from place to place in search of food, although some species members have evolved with webbed claws.

            With their barbed hides that deflect attacks, their intense fire blasts that blind opponents, and their tail triad that braids into a single powerful weapon, a Triple Stryke wins most bouts on intimidation alone. 
            But victory sometimes breeds vanity and exploiting this overconfidence is often the only way to defeat a Triple Stryke in battle. A Triple Stryke's braided tail is a force to be reckoned with, but each tail produces a unique venom. 
            A sting from the first tail numbs combatants, the second disorients them with mild hallucinogens, and the third creates an agonizing of burning in your very blood." <br><br> — Dragonpedia</p></div>

Fortunately for Bewilderbeasts, there are few other dragons in the world that can match their intimidating stature and ever hope to compete for the designation of "king of all dragons".

When not swelling its body up to yell, Thunderdrums can actually flatten their body by expelling all oxygen from their massive lungs for a limited period of time. In this sleeker state, Thunderdrums can better skim the ocean surface or even dive beneath the waves in search of prey.
            While it's true that Thunderdrums create tremendous amounts of noise, they also possess the ability to cancel out each other's sonic blasts. By modulating its roars to the proper frequency, a Thunderdrum can use its soundwaves to negate an attacking Thunderdrum's bellow, rendering it into a rather calming wave of white noise." <br><br> — Dragonpedia</p></div>
